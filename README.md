Pokémon Basics provides beginners with basic descriptions of the first 151 Pokémon as well as competitive movesets for battle. Pokémon Basics is powered by [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and [@pkmn/smogon](https://pkmn.github.io/smogon/).

### while making this app i learned:

- how to style a scrollbar (on chromium-based browsers)

- react-router's `<Outlet>` has a context provider built into it

- [react's StrictMode intentionally causes components to render twice in order to help find accidental side effects](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/15074#issuecomment-471197572)

### and i got more practice with:

- css animations

- dealing with setbacks

- flexbox

- react hooks

### there's a lot that could still be done, like:

- implementing [concurrent rendering](https://reactjs.org/blog/2021/06/08/the-plan-for-react-18.html#whats-coming-in-react-18) for a smoother user experience and for cleaner code

- tightening the css so that the webpage looks good no matter the user's device or preferred font settings
